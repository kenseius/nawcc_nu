### What Is a Page? 

Every site contains **pages**. Pages are where all of our ui components and content live.

> A web page or web page is a document commonly written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) that is accessible through the Internet or other network using an Internet browser. A web page is accessed by entering a URL address and may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.

        <div>

### Base Page Template

At a minimum, each page must contain: 

- Topnav - `<nav>`
- Header - Hero Banner - `<header>`
- A Main wrapper - `<main>`
  - Content Sections - `<section>`
- The footer - `<footer>`
    
This can also be considered the Boilerplate template (base minimum for starting development).

## Vertical Navigation 

The Web App Standards's design system, along with most modern websites, is built for vertical navigation. 

Meaning, they're designed to guide the user's focus _down the page_, while ensuring navigation is always immediately apparent and available. 

- user's both expect and prefer to scroll on a website (versus zooming in)
- the visual positioning, weight and vertical scale are all intended to subtly encourange the user to scroll.
