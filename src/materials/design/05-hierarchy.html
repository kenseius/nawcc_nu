The basic site hierarchy is as follows: 

Every page can be either a **parent** or a **child**.

**Parents** are any page that links to any number of subpages.

**Child** are the bottom of the navigation chain --- in other words, pages that do not have children pages. 

- Parents must provide navigation to their children. 

Parent > Child
Parent > Parent > Child
