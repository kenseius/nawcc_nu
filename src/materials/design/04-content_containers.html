Content on each page can be arranged into **sections**. 

**Sections** can contain all UI Informational Content components. In fact, this is where the majority of all content will reside, either immediately, or within subsections. 

**Sections** can be styled as full-width portions of a page, or as cards. 

**Sections** can have subsections, which can be arranged and navigated using UI Informational Layout components. 

Content containers that can contain `sections`:  

- `body` 
- `main` 
- `article`
- `section` 
- `header`
- `footer`

### Section Appearance

There are three types of visual approaches that apply when styling a section: 

- **Default** - Styled to appear like it's part of  a page, the default section styling is full-width background, the the contents centered within, limited to a max-width of 1024px (`$base-max-width`)
- **Cards** - sections can be styled to appear within padded containers called *cards*. 
-  **Full** - Sections that are the full width and height of a viewport.

- Tabs
- Accordions
- Heros



### UI Components In Sections

Once we've identified the type of content, considered common usage patterns, and applyied a bit of psychology and color theory, we're able to use various UI elements to guide a user's attention and interactions through the interface. 

(Usability.gov)[usability.gov]

A UI is composed of four categories:

- **navigation**
  topnav, sidenav, search field forms, pagination, tags, icons
- **input**
  text field, date fields, dropdown lists, checkboxes, clickable buttons, toggles
- **information**
  text content, tooltips, message boxes, alerts, notifications, icons, progress bars, charts, modals
- **sharing**
  friend lists, follow buttons, like/promote, share buttons

After we assemble our UI elements in the best way that accomplishes the user's objectives, we're able to start identifing reusable **layouts**, **templates** and **themes**.
