### Implementing just SASS / CSS 

Start To Finish: 

1. install node.js  
* install npm  
    * installing gulp and dependencies
* install gulp  
    * gulpfile
    * dependencies  
* install sass
* create html5 file structure

Strapless's SASS code base is built around the assumption that your markup is semantic.
