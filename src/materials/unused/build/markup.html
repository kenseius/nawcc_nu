## HTML5 / CSS3

Regardless of backend technology used (whether its Azure, .NET, Sharepoint, Wordpress), the frontend is nearly always going to be composed of markup (HTML) and styling (CSS).

mark up = HTML5
styling = CSS3

HTML is also referred to as **markup**. 

It's used to structure the content that appears on websites. 

It does so in conjuction with CSS and JS to build the presentational part of modern websites.

Browsers on all devices and screen readers look to HTML to understand how to portray different information. 

Through various tags (`<h1>,<p>,<ul>` etc.), HTML takes advantage of the informational hierchy inherent in the content we place on websites.

For example: 

~~~html

<main>
    <h1>The Site Title</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>This Site's Main Section Title</h2>
        <p>Sentence containing body text. h1-h5 need to nest in a numerically consistent way, but p's can be used anywhere within a wrapper</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Sub-Section Title</h3>
            <p>Sub-section body text.</p>
            <h3>Sub-Section Title</h3>
            <p>Sub-section body text.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
</main>

We'll get into content strategy later. For now, the main distinction to understand in our approach to building websites is the difference between **containers** and **content**.

Every HTML website contains content. 

HTML tags used for content are referred to as _inline_ elements. They include: 

- h1
- h2
- h3
- h4
- h5
- p 
- ul
- ol
- blockquote
- img
- iframe (mostly used for embedding social media content)

HTML has evolved over the eons to become HTML5, which not only gives us  to organize content into a logical 

Thinking about the meaning of the content helps us understand how to portray it. 

At the same time, it frees us from the need to apply further markup (add classes, nest deeper within divs, sections, or other containers).


In other words, so long as the content is entered semantically, it will naturally appear correctly.


Regardless of cosmetic visual differences, a design system
