Before we can begin laying out a website, we must first look at the **Content**. 

No, you don't need to invest hours into reading someone's blog --- you just need to identify the **type of content**.

Thinking in the context of an HTML5 document, these are the primary content types:

- **informational text** : is this content meant to be **read**?
- **media** : is this content meant to be **viewed**?
- **CTA Funnel** : is the user being directed **to do something**? 
- **data entry** : is the user being asked to **input information**? 

Depending on the type of content being portrayed, we'll choose a design pattern to structure our layout.

## Design Patterns

**Design Patterns** are developed by observing the "flow" of a user's attention throughout their interactions with a website.

We begin to find Design Patterns by conducting user research, and identifying common usage patterns. 

On the Commonwealth's websites, there are three predominant design patterns. 

- **F-pattern**
- **Z-pattern**
- **V-pattern**

<section class="layout_grid col2">
    <div>
        <h3>F-Pattern</h3>
        <p>This is for text-heavy pages, like articles and blog feeds.</p> 
        <p>It draws your attention down and across, as you scan through article titles or a list of content.</p>
    </div>

</section> 

<section class="layout_grid col2">
    <div>
        <h3>Z-Pattern</h3>
        <p>This is used for nearly all other layouts.</p>
        <p>It draws your attention across the top, then diagonally down to the left, before directing your attention horizontally across the viewport.</p>

</section> 

<section class="layout_grid col2">
    <div>
        <h3>V-Pattern</h3>
        <p>This is used for Call To Actions or featured content that's been visually centered.</p>
        <p>It draws the viewers attention down and inward, towards a central focal point.</p>

Once we've identified the type of content, considered common usage patterns, and applyied a bit of psychology and color theory, we're able to use various UI elements to guide a user's attention and interactions through the interface. 


(Usability.gov)[usability.gov]

A UI is composed of four categories:

- **navigation**
  topnav, sidenav, search field forms, pagination, tags, icons
- **input**
  text field, date fields, dropdown lists, checkboxes, clickable buttons, toggles
- **information**
  text content, tooltips, message boxes, alerts, notifications, icons, progress bars, charts, modals
- **sharing**
  friend lists, follow buttons, like/promote, share buttons

After we assemble our UI elements in the best way that accomplishes the user's objectives, we're able to start identifing reusable **layouts**, **templates** and **themes**.

### Vertical Navigation 

Strapless's design system, along with most modern websites, is built for vertical navigation. 

Meaning, they're designed to guide the user's focus _down the page_, while ensuring navigation is always immediately apparent and available. 

- user's both expect and prefer to scroll on a website (versus zooming in)
- the visual positioning, weight and vertical scale are all intended to subtly encourange the user to scroll.

    <section class="layout_grid col2">
        <div>
            <h3>Top Nav</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Navigation</strong></p>
            <p>Used for moving the user across top-level website pages, or sections within a single-page site (like pa.gov)</p>
            <p>To ensure navigation is always available to the user, the topnav remains fixed to the top of the page, on mobile and desktop.</p>
{{#markdown}}
Navigation is reserved for moving a user from one point in the site to another. 
It should remain consistent across every page of a given site, and should adapt to the screen size to ensure navigation is equally possible for every user.
                
Navigation should be visually distinct and visually constant. Meaning, if the navigation is at the top on the home page, it should be there on a subpage. 

As with buttons, provided visual distinction and consistency are observed, there is no need to underline the text.  

It's acceptable to use buttons within the topnav, like the "Escape" button in the example. It should fill the entire height and width of a nav-item.

Navigation items can also have assocated icons, though it's not required. 

In general, you should not put any external links in the navigation. If you can't avoid it, they must have an exernal link icon.

<!-- 

This takes the form of several basic body / container layout configuartions. Specical consideration is given to using semantic HTML containers.

Two different content types:

- article
- section 

From this, we're able to develop page layouts: 

- Admin GUI
- Single Page
- Home Page  

Their usage is based on what sort of content they contain. 

- One column: Full Width
- One column: Base Max Width
- One column: Article Max Width
- Two column: Base Max Width


Content types are then sorted by their purpose or usage: 

- main
- article
- section
- forms -->
