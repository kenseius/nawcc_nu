### Consistency

    “Consistency is important because it creates trust. And design is all about creating relationships between products and users.”

The central goal of this styleguide is to ensure consistency. Whenever a project requires a common, often-repeated UX element (top nav, for example), rather than looking to prior projects or creating something from scratch, this will provide a central usage position.


### Accessibility + Semantics first
Because we’re taking a semantics-first approach, as much of the layout and design appearance as possible is hoisted out of the markup (ie. “div soup”) and into the CSS, enabled largely through SASS. SASS also provides an easy way to implement standards via variables and to break down the complicated code elements into bite-sized chunks via partials.
The major goals for the code in this style guide include an emphasis on simple, direct, semantic-focused markup. The idea is to enforce Information Architecture leads the way when organizing the layout and content of your website.


### Emphasize the Content and the Brand

Our goal for this framework is to not let the design get in the way. By genericizing commone elements, we're able to emphasize brand elements, like color, logos and images. 
    

### Mirrored Atomicity 

The design and the code should match as closely as possible. 

When designing, think about your UI elements as semantic wrappers. Likewise, when developing, visualize each component as a physical container.

### Visual Design Approach

- Flat design with elements of Material Design
- to improve readability, and a buffer for increasing contrast, no absolute blacks or whites are used 
- most colors are muted, to emphasize content (especially images), and to appear inviting and unaggressive, plus it allows one main color to standout where appropriate 
- Colors derived from old pa.gov colors, existing colorschemes, and reflects the governors site
