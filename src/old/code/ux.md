### Intro & Summary

'UX'

These letters show up often in our industry, but what exactly do they mean, even? This guide is built as both an entry point and a user manual for applying UX throughout the entire website-creation process. 
	
### Purpose & Goals

#### Purpose 

- Define the role of UX @ PAI
- Define the role of UX as it pertains to our stakeholders

#### Goals 

- Define the role of UX in modern web development
- Demonstrate the value of UX 
- Display an ideal UX model as applied to PAI's workflow
- Develop a system for measuring our UX capacity / output
- Analyze our past and current UX capacity / output
- Plan phased-in methods for integrating UX into our process
- Establish if there's a need for a UX Department
- Create an estimated Projection: analyze impact and value

### Guiding Philosphy

The central philosophical idea that propels the UX process is **Design Thinking**. 

I. What is Design Thinking?
II. How does it apply to eGovernment 

#### I. What is Design Thinking?

Design Thinking is a problem-solving philosophy. It’s currently trending among company leaders and within the UX community. 

**Google Trends** 

> "Results show that over the last 10 years design-led companies have maintained significant stock market advantage, outperforming the S&P by an extraordinary 228%.” (via DMI: Design Management Institute)

Design Thinking applies the user-centered, multifaceted thought process of modern designers and artists to non-design problems. This thought process has three main components: 

1. **redefine the problem** - rather than jump to a solution, “take the original problem as a suggestion” then think broadly about the real underlying issues. In other words, challenge assumptions; question & investigate the conditions of a problem to find the root issue. 

	> “Don’t try to search for a solution until [determining] the real problem.” (via “What Is Design Thinking And Why Is It So Popular")

2. **human-centric perspective** - (aka UX) - view the problem from the user’s perspective, and build the solution around this. This is a huge part of Design Thinking, as it applies context to the other parts of Design Thinking, identifies a target audience, provides a way to measure performance and judge a project’s output, and brings meaning to otherwise seemingly arbitrary designs. 

3. **test & verify everything** - experiment, prototype, “try on for size” each solution, research, learn, play, poke & prod, and use real data to back your conclusions. This is an opportunity to revisit and redefine your own solution. 

This breaks down into 5 non-sequential steps. (via “What Is Design Thinking And Why Is It So Popular")

- **Empathise** – with your users
- **Define** – your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights
- **Ideate** – by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions
- **Prototype** – to start creating solutions
- **Test** – solutions

"Think Different(ly)” an article from Zurb (i.e. the people that makes the popular framework Foundation), refers to it as “divergent thinking”, and uses Steve Jobs’ success with Apple to explain it’s advantages. It also brings up some of the challenges that comes with this approach:

- there tends to be two ways of viewing problems - critical, and creative; divergent thinking brings these two inherently different approaches together
- Creative thinking is unnatural to critical thinkers, which causes frustration for the critical thinker, and can create friction between the two thinking types.
- Further, since it doesn’t come naturally, it feels risky, and requires "the guts to breakout of conventional trends to design what is best for our customers.”(via "Think Different(ly)")
- The solution is culture. “Lead by design” - ie. Have empathy for coworkers, and create structures for people to work within. 

> "The success of the elite worker will depend upon that person's ability not to get things done, but to have breakthroughs'''to use access to knowledge and automation to deliver explosive ideas. To do that which only a human can do." David Cadaver

Examples of applying design thinking to concepts (all via  "In Search Of The Ultimate User Experience”) 

**Products:** 

- While evaluating a product or service is subjective, defining the problem narrows this down to 2 things: utility & emotion. 
	- > "Utility and emotion are simple measures to evaluate any product on."
	- > “Utility is mandatory...If a product passes the utility test, then it will elicit an appropriate emotional response.” 
	- Remember: "Forgettable experiences are forgotten products.”

**Workplace**: 

> “[The] workplace is a product. People spend most of their lives working, and this insight gave birth to the destination work experience.”

> "We can create a better world faster through collaboration, open communication, and exposure to  feedback and criticism. Makers understandably apply the user experience concept within their organizations. It’s a logical progression."

There are two primary strategies for doing that:

- Develop a strong workplace culture
- Get mission-driven

**Overall Better World:** "creating a better world begins with a single user who wants a solution to their problem—and it starts with your product or service. If your product is worthy, it spreads—first through communities (offline or online), then beyond borders to other countries and continents.”

### II. So, how does this apply to eGovernment?

**Define the Problem**

It’s common for Krystal or the agencies to bring up problems by presenting a solution. Ideally, we’ll bring Krystal to the point where she’s coming to us with “I don’t feel like the logo text is visible enough” instead of “make the logo 200-400% larger”; until then, we should make a habit of asking or, at least, thinking first about the actual root problem. 

**Human-Centric Perspective**

This is where UX, visual design, and accessibility come into play. 

We aren’t just building products, especially since our product is digital, we’re building the experience the user has with the product. By thinking like the user, we can take as much pain as possible out of mundane online government forms and improve the overall clarity of the state’s online communication with its citizens (which corresponds nicely with the whole open data, government transparency thing).

> "The human experience trumps everything, and a product or service that’s designed with a contextual view of someone’s life will dominate the marketplace.”

**Challenges**
A challenge for this perspective, especially for the eGovernment industry, is implementing improvements in a way that isn’t jarring for the user. According to Paul Rand, "The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with.” 

**Precedence In Gov’t**

It’s being implemented by gov.uk - ("User Centered Design”)

**Philosophic Rationale**
We’re empowering the user by giving them access to information, without interfering with the message; improving the experience for humans, instead of for politicians or bureaucrats or ourselves. 

> "We believe makers and users can aspire to something greater. The maker can create something profitable AND meaningful. The user can be a more conscientious consumer. Together, we can build remarkable things that does less harm and maximum good in the world."

I believe this is best explained by "In Search Of The Ultimate User Experience”: 

> “As the definition of a product evolves, so do its users. The empowered consumer shapes a product’s trajectory with reviews, online activism, customer feedback, and focus groups. The empowered user remains your traditional customer, but they’re also your employees, a city’s residents, and a political party’s constituents.

Users are slowly realizing they have power to change these institutions. This happens with big companies (Taylor Swift and Apple), the toppling of dictators (hello, Arab Spring), and influencing how big government operates (Obama’s geeks).

Forward-thinking makers are collaborating with their power users more and more on mutually beneficial projects. This exchange results in products and services that are not only relevant, but higher in quality.”

And for convenience here’s my references and a few other links I haven’t read yet, but look promising:

### UX Value 

Value 
--------

TODO: Rephrase this around the Value UX brings in general, then the value I bring to facilitate this. 

- [Communicating the UX Value Proposition](http://uxmag.com/articles/communicating-the-ux-value-proposition)

> "There's probably nothing more frustrating to a UX designer than the feeling (or reality) that the value of one's discipline is constantly brought into question, and given lower priority to other business objectives.
>
> In this situation, it is easy for the UX designer to feel that the end users are being neglected, and that the quality of the product or service will suffer due to neglect. It is also extremely difficult to debate your position without the support of the quantitative metrics used to argue for other business objectives—the same metrics that lowered UX priorities in the first place."
> [Communicating The UX Value Proposition](http://uxmag.com/articles/communicating-the-ux-value-proposition)


### Value Diagram


> The completed diagram provides a visual representation of:
> 
> - key business objectives 
> - how UX attributes relate to those objectives
> - the current and desired state of success
> - the activities that will be completed to meet those objectives.
> 
> [Communicating The UX Value Proposition](http://uxmag.com/articles/communicating-the-ux-value-proposition)


1. Identify key business objectives
2. Identify the UX attributes that will influence the success (both directly and indirectly) of the key objectives and desired outcomes  
 At a minimum, the UX attributes that should be considered in a project include:
 * Usability– How easy to understand and operate does the product need to be?
 * Appeal– How professional does the product need to appear? How much does the audience need to enjoy using it?
 * Accessibility– What audiences need to access the product? On which devices?
 * Performance– How well does the application need to perform? How fast does it need to load and respond to input?
 * User Assistance & Help– How easy does it need to be for the audience to get assistance when they get stuck?
 Simple statements or descriptions of how these attributes influence the key objectives are sufficient.
3. Identify the current success of these UX attributes - plot on a scale from poor (1) to excellent (5)
4. Identify the desired state of these UX attributes - plot on a scale from poor (1) to excellent (5)
5. Identify the activities and design work that can be done to improve the state of the UX


> An important aspect to the success of any project is to obtain consensus with stakeholders on what it means to succeed, and how we will know if our UX work has been successful.
>
> When the value proposition of UX is directly associated with key business objectives, it is much easier to have quality discussions about time and budget for UX activities. Helping your stakeholders understand how UX directly and indirectly influences their key business objectives allows you to focus more time on critical work and might help you increase the budgets and time you are allocated for UX initiatives.

## UX = User Experience

The User Experience (UX) is created when the user interacts with the user interface (UI).

By focusing first on understanding the user and his or her needs, we can focus design and development efforts directly around a measurable impact.

### Build For Users

## UX = User + UI

> **Understand The User**
> _in order to_
> **Build The UI**

As you read this, UX is being generated as you interact and react to this document.

`you (the user) + this document (the UI) = user experience`


## UX Cycle

- UX Phases
- UX Process
- UX Roles
- UX Deliverables 

The UX Cycle encompases the entire scope of any given project, from inception to User On-Boarding. 

It's broken down into phases, which describe steps of progress in the product's journey. Along each step of the phase, teams and UX roles will be building cyclically, using the UX Process, with many back-and-forth conversations between multiple team members. 

### UX Phases

- I. Learn

This is what we know as the "Requirements Gathering" phase. It's the introduction to the subject for the entire team, and lays down the groundwork for the following phases. It's most important output are the **UX Objectives**. 

The **UX Objectives**, in turn, empower design and development to build the UI.

##### User Persona Scenarios

Scenarios add elasticity to personas by  lling in the “why” behind the “who”. 
- Ben Hunt, creator of Web Design From Scratch,

There are three main categories: 

* goal-based scenarios 
* elaborated scenarios
* full task scenarios 

1. create realistic goals for your personas.
2. Each user scenario starts with a user story, structured as:  
 “As a [role], [the persona] wants to [complete this action] so they can [ful ll this goal]”
 "A user scenario will then expand upon user stories by including details about how your system could be interpreted, experienced, and used."
 
* The persona’s environment — Where are they when they interact with your web site? Are they at work? At a coffee shop? Or at home?
* Any factors that impact the context of use — How fast and stable is their Internet connection? How much time do they have? What distractions are there?
* Triggering events & goals — What specific goal motivates the persona to interact with the web site on this occasion? What event triggered this scenario?
* Persona behavior — Visualize the scene. What considerations are most important in the persona’s mind? What clues are they looking for in particular?

# UX Audit

## UX Score

Measured by UX Deliverables

## Project History Audit


1. **COPA Metrics:**

 - **Frontend Framework**: built using Foundation, with styles customized on top of Foundation's _Pre-Compiled CSS_.  
 - **Styles**: CSS, non-compiled. It was decided to code this using .css early on, which proved unmnagable by the end.
 - **Markup**: Bulky, unsemantic (in order to use foundation, the markup doe not denote meaning on its own, and is mostly used for styling)
 - **CMS**: Wordpress
 - **Lessons learned**:
     - coding in pure CSS is entirely too slow and cumbersome.
     - Preserve code used to counter Foundation's boiled in styles.  
     - There was no guidelines or codebase to build from --- I needed to learn, decide, or build as I went.
     - In the end, the project was a success.

2. **PA.GOV**:

 - **Frontend Framework**: built using Foundation, customized on top of Foundation's _Pre-Compiled CSS_.  
 - **Styles**: SCSS, on top of the newest build of Foundation's _Pre-Compiled CSS_, with code brought over from COPA Metrics where appropriate and to counter Foundation's styles
 - **Markup**: Cleaner, due to an effort to minimize markup where-ever possible. Not completely semantic, as there wasn't time to wrangle with Foundation's styles to adapt to a more semantic markup.
 - **CMS**: Wordpress
 - **Lessons learned**:

     - Many of the issues from COPA Metrics were solved by using SASS. A project that size and prone to sudden change coulnd't have been built using anything else.
     - Early on, a lesson learned from COPA Metrics was the need to organize and systemize the design assets. Because nothing of the sort existed yet, building our framework with Foundation is the best choice available.
     - It also made several things clear about working with Foundation:  
		- Foundation is excellent for rapid prototyping, but as a project matures, becomes cumbersome, then entirely unnecessary.  
		- We were unable to safely work with Foundation's _scss_, because it would get overwritten everytime they updated the codebase.
		- near the end, it became increasingly difficult to manage, and ironning out the finer points of mobile styling became very time-consumming.
		- Our style base had matured to the point that the only thing we were using from Foundation was a hand-full of mixins and a plugin called What-Input (which we're still using because it's amazing). We used their grid for some positioning, but ultimately relied on it very minimally. At mobile, other than supplying the breakpoints, Foundation made no difference to the appearance whatsoever.


3. **Agency Template**:

 - **Frontend Framework**: built using Foundation, customized on top of Foundation's _Compiled CSS_  
 - **Styles**: CSS, build on Foundations *compiled CSS*, and built to adapt to Sharepoint's built-in markup & styles
 - **Markup**: Bulky, unsemantic, difficult to manage
 - **CMS**: Sharepoint 2010
 - **Lessons learned**:
	- The massive maintainability issues were caused by two things:
		- Building on the *Compiled CSS* was a huge error. Immensely difficult to modify.
		- Letting Sharepoint control the markup. Sharepoint markup is _not_ accessable, and carries a large blame for our accessability failure last summer.
		- Until fixing the two causes of the maintainability issue, no matter what framework we use, these problem will persist.
		- Regardless of framework, it would be quicker to start from scratch than to 'fix' the old template.
		- Avoid re-using the old agency template

3. **DGS: State Construction Notices Directory**

 - **Frontend Framework**: built using our `Style Asset Library`. In other words, framework-free.
 - **Styles**: SCSS. The `Style Asset Library` = the styles brought over from PA.Gov, without Foundation. The decision was made during this project to move away from Foundation entirely. From Foundation, we kept 'What-Input', about 5 mixins, and to replace Foundation's grid, we're used a Sass-based tool called Susy. Other than those things, Foundation brought nothing to the table that our `Style Asset Library` wasn't already handling.
 - **Markup**: Semantic, clean, and minimal. Built in VSTS, using Razor (MVC ?) to generate partials
 - **Lessons learned**:ß
	 - making the move away from Foundation came with growing pains, and wasn't immediately accepted.
	 - In addition to standardizing the styles, the choice was made to begin standardizing the HTML5 markup as well. However, without a centralized and definitive resource to define the markup, this could lead to confusion.
	 - The need to have a central authority on 'correct' markup comes up : for it, I'm referring to HTML5's latest docs, the latest Accessability best practices, and one prevalent rule: Use The Least Amount Of Markup Possible
	 - the `Style Asset Library` is incomplete without also standardizing the markup; in other words, everything needs to be more modular.
     - began building this standardize library via a Styleguide, stored in a directory within the site

4. **PBPP: Most Wanted Absconders**

 - **Frontend Framework**: built using the matured `Style Asset Library` from DGS. This time, adapted to include standardized semantic / accessability markup.
 - **Styles**: SCSS. The `Style Asset Library` +
 - **Markup**: Semantic, clean, and minimal. Built in VSTS, using Razor (MVC ?) to generate partials
 - **Lessons learned**:
	- Though unnamed, this was the test implementation of `Strapless`: semantic, assessable markup + `Style Asset Library`
	- The project was built rapidly, with a rapid bug-fixing phase.
	- Also stores a 'Styleguide' directory within the site, a more mature (though very early) version of Strapless's styleguide output

5. **Strapless, PSP, Employment, and Beyond**

## Current State Of UX @ PAI 


### Process

1. **PM + DESIGN + DEV + PARTNER**: Requirements Gathering
2. **PM**: Put together requirements into a doc **> DESIGN**
3. **PM or DESIGN**: Create wireframes **> DESIGN**
5. **DESIGN**: create mockups **> PM**
7. **[ Design Asset Delivery ]**  

 Deliver design assets to Partner for approval. This step involves one or both of these two things:  
 - **PM > PARTNER**: send the PM exported assets  
 - **PM + DESIGN > PARTNER**: Presentations

8. **DESIGN**: revisions based on partner feedback  **> PM  > PARTNER**
9. **DESIGN + PM + PARTNER**: repeat steps 7-9 as needed, until partner gives final approval of designs. Ideally, 1-2 cycles for most projects.
10. **DESIGN + DEV**: adjust toolkit materials based on mockups, create new materials as needed.  

After this step: `backend development`, `launch`, and `post-launch maintenance`

Here's How To Fix: (from my email to Adam, adjust to apply to UX in general, also add other points)

* **Define the UX Department** - In terms of the department's role, responsibilities, and position in overall project flow
* **centralized, visual workflow** - What projects are coming up, what projects is everyone working on 
* **requirements gathering** coordinate process  


# SOLUTION 


Process
----

I. **Requirements Gathering**
- UX (IA, Visual Design) + PM + Dev
- Partner

1. **UX (IA, Visual Design) + PM + DEV + PARTNER**: Initial meeting, ideally in person, with all stakeholders.
2. **UX IA + PM** Build User Personas, based on *Data*, *Target Demographics*, and *Partner Input*
3. **UX IA + PM** Build User Scenarios, to identify UX objectives.
4. **PM** Put together User Personas, User Scenarios, technical and design requirements into a doc
5. **UX + PM > PARTNER**  Communicate and agree with partner on user personas, either through a meeting or via email.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 as needed, until approval.

II. **Design & Storyboard**

8. **Information Architect**: Create System Maps, Process Flows, then wireframes **> DESIGN**
9. **VISUAL DESIGN**: create mockups (concept designs (stills)) **> INTERACTIVE DESIGN**
10. **INTERACTIVE DESIGN / Front-end Developer**: prototypes **> QA / A/B Testing**
11. **QA / A/B Testing** Test solution against UX objectives (step 3). **QA > UX (IA, VISUAL DESIGN, INTERACTIVE DESIGN), PM > PARTNER**  

 Repeat steps 8 - 11 until passing internal tests.

12. **[ Design Asset Delivery ]**  

  Deliver design assets to Partner for approval. This step involves one or both of these two things:  
  - **PM > PARTNER**: send the PM exported assets  
  - **PM + DESIGN > PARTNER**: Presentations

13. **UX (IA, DESIGN)**: revisions based on partner feedback  **> PM  > PARTNER**
14. **DESIGN + PM + PARTNER**: repeat steps 8-11 as needed, until partner gives final approval of designs. Ideally, 1-2 cycles for most projects.
15. **DESIGN + DEV**: adjust toolkit materials based on mockups, create new materials as needed.  

After this step: `backend development`, `launch`, and `post-launch maintenance`'

Questions This Answers: 

* Why Me? 
* Why me, versus someone else internally?
* Why me, versus someone externally? 
* What Value Do I Bring?
* What Will Happen If I'm Not Made UX Director?
* Would I be more useful in another department or doing another task? 

--

- I've played incrementally stronger and more central parts of every key successful project I've been assigned
 
- Central to my process is a focus on *bringing value* to both PAI and our Partner. 
- I bring that value through a dedication to observing UX Design and Frontend Development standards, trends, methods. 
- More importantly, I merge what I'm learning back into what I produce, ultimately improving it. 
	- Using this process, I've been building a frontend asset toolkit of the best and most consistent & standards-aherent code
 
- Along side, I've been developing a plan for the UX department. I need more time to bring the plan to full bloom, but I don't want to keep it secret and I'm at a point where external insight begins to become very be helpful  
 
- I'm useless for migrations. 

- Versus Others (internal / external hire)
 
	1. I've been doing this work already: 
  	
        - director  
        - design architech

	- Communication:
		- Along side the **UX Liaison**, see the **Inner-Office Coordination** plan through
		- **Directors**: Planning, resource allocation meetings
	- Frontend Code: 
		- Scope: HTML5, CSS3, CMS
		- Accessability, & Semantics, include UX in Frontend Development's Process 
		- Director level authority input on technology choices  
		- Architech of HTML5 & CSS3, to ensure Accessability, Semantics, and Consistency with Design Assets  


- **UX Designer**

	- Front-end Coder
	- Interaction Designer
	- Visual Designer
	- Prototyper
 
- **UX Analyst**

	- User Researcher
	- Information Architect
	- Usability Expert 
	- Content Strategist
	- Systems Analysts

- **UX Liaison** (Internal Analysis, Systems Management, & Communications)
 
	- User Research (Commonwealth, PAI)
	- Project Manager for Internal UX Projects	
	- **Tools**: Internal Systems Analysis
	- **Communication**:
		- **Directors**: Planning, resource allocation meetings
		- **Commonwealth**: Requirements Gathering 
		- **Inner Office Coordination**: Facilitate bringing UX into the existing processes of other departments

Inner-Office Coordination
--------

> The more you educate others about your UX process and overall vision, the easier it is to gain buy-in on growth for your team.
> 
> Our UX team exposes the entire process from our initial research to ideation stages, all the way to final visual design, microinteractions, and prototypes. 
> 
> Exposing those roles to other teams and management helps identify the varying workloads that a full enterprise UX team takes on. Plus, sharing your team’s process fosters cross-functional collaboration with external teams—and drives future ideation.
> 
> [Building An Enterprise UX Team](http://blog.invisionapp.com/building-an-enterprise-ux-team/) 

### Marketing 

- leverage tracy's talents for getting us in front of target markets for research  
	- likely, largely for conducting surveys and polling and A/B testing 
	- otherwise: meet with Tracy to truely grasp nature of her duties and goals


### QA

- leverage Jerinna's focus for conducting tests of apps. 
- meet with her to coordinate docs with her Play Book entry


### PM 

I. Coordinate **Requirements Gathering** Process

* Have a design / dev presence be in ALL requirements gathering
* This will enable UX-centered discussions immediately from the start
* Moreso, if we _don't_ begin a UX-centered discussion at the beginning, you can't add it in afterwards. UX conversations should always begin by analyzing the user's needs --- trying to apply UX thinking after requirements have already been set in stone essentially means starting again from the beginning. 
* If not, design cannot be held responsible for extra time needed to accomplish UX

II. Coordinate Tasks & Unify Workflow

* **documentation** coordinate + centralize 
	- the PMs have been building a playbook --- let's share! 
 	- store all docs from other depts in same repo. 
 	- Standardized documentation writing method (Word doc vrs. Markdown) 
* **knowledge sharing**
	- educate PMs to **UX + Asking Questions**
 	- Provide PM Team: **List of Things to Ask + Approaches to UX**
 	- Provide PM Team complete **library of web components** w/ specs, should they want to see what we're actually selling
* Find **central tool** for the Requirements > Prototype stages (or one that goes beyond the Prototype stage)
	- UX Pin 
	- InVision
	- Others 
* Unify **wireframe tool** 
 	- adobe v. balsamiq
 	- Unify, build or document recurring wireframe patterns 


### Dev 
	
* Knowledge Share (via Jakob's meeting)
	- Every other week 1 different person from team must present?  
* Framework Maintenance Coordination
	- Coordinate w/ Corey on Framework JS
* Documentation & Process
 	- would help with appearing more granually involved with project if many tasks get completed instead of just big over-arching category-based tasks. 



Documentation 
--------

#### Bridging The Gap

- We're all on different levels. Regardless of the results a skill audit, we still need to bridge this knowledge gap somehow, or at least center it somewhere from whence to base discussions or explanations when sharing about code.
