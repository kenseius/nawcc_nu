## Old Process

1. **PM + DESIGN + DEV + PARTNER**: Requirements Gathering
2. **PM**: Put together requirements into a doc **---> DESIGN**
3. **PM or DESIGN**: Create wireframes **---> DESIGN**
5. **DESIGN**: create mockups **---> PM**
7. **[ Design Asset Delivery ]**  

 Deliver design assets to Partner for approval. This step involves one or both of these two things:  
 - **PM ---> PARTNER**: send the PM exported assets  
 - **PM + DESIGN ---> PARTNER**: Presentations

8. **DESIGN**: revisions based on partner feedback  **---> PM  ---> PARTNER**
9. **DESIGN + PM + PARTNER**: repeat steps 7-9 as needed, until partner gives final approval of designs. Ideally, 1-2 cycles for most projects.
10. **DESIGN + DEV**: adjust toolkit materials based on mockups, create new materials as needed.  

After this step: `backend development`, `launch`, and `post-launch maintenance`



## New Process

I. **Requirements Gathering**
- UX (IA, Visual Design) + PM + Dev
- Partner

1. **UX (IA, Visual Design) + PM + DEV + PARTNER**: Initial meeting, ideally in person, with all stakeholders.
2. **UX IA + PM** Build User Personas, based on *Data*, *Target Demographics*, and *Partner Input*
3. **UX IA + PM** Build User Scenarios, to identify UX objectives.
4. **PM** Put together User Personas, User Scenarios, technical and design requirements into a doc
5. **UX + PM ---> PARTNER**  Communicate and agree with partner on user personas, either through a meeting or via email.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 as needed, until approval.

II. **Design & Storyboard**

8. **Information Architect**: Create System Maps, Process Flows, then wireframes **---> DESIGN**
9. **VISUAL DESIGN**: create mockups (concept designs (stills)) **---> INTERACTIVE DESIGN**
10. **INTERACTIVE DESIGN / Front-end Developer**: prototypes **---> QA / A/B Testing**
11. **QA / A/B Testing** Test solution against UX objectives (step 3). **QA ---> UX (IA, VISUAL DESIGN, INTERACTIVE DESIGN), PM ---> PARTNER**  

 Repeat steps 8 - 11 until passing internal tests.

12. **[ Design Asset Delivery ]**  

  Deliver design assets to Partner for approval. This step involves one or both of these two things:  
  - **PM ---> PARTNER**: send the PM exported assets  
  - **PM + DESIGN ---> PARTNER**: Presentations

13. **UX (IA, DESIGN)**: revisions based on partner feedback  **---> PM  ---> PARTNER**
14. **DESIGN + PM + PARTNER**: repeat steps 8-11 as needed, until partner gives final approval of designs. Ideally, 1-2 cycles for most projects.
15. **DESIGN + DEV**: adjust toolkit materials based on mockups, create new materials as needed.  

After this step: `backend development`, `launch`, and `post-launch maintenance`
