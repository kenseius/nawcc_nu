<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>PM + DESIGN + DEV + PARTNER</strong>: Requirements Gathering</li>
<li><strong>PM</strong>: Put together requirements into a doc <strong>---&gt; DESIGN</strong> </li>
<li><strong>PM or DESIGN</strong>: Create wireframes <strong>---&gt; DESIGN</strong></li>
<li><strong>DESIGN</strong>: create mockups <strong>---&gt; PM</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>[ Design Asset Delivery ]</strong>  </p>
<p>Deliver design assets to Partner for approval. This step involves one or both of these two things:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PM ---&gt; PARTNER</strong>: send the PM exported assets  </li>
<li><strong>PM + DESIGN ---&gt; PARTNER</strong>: Presentations </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DESIGN</strong>: revisions based on partner feedback  <strong>---&gt; PM  ---&gt; PARTNER</strong></p>
</li>
<li><strong>DESIGN + PM + PARTNER</strong>: repeat steps 7-9 as needed, until partner gives final approval of designs. Ideally, 1-2 cycles for most projects.</li>
<li><strong>DESIGN + DEV</strong>: adjust toolkit materials based on mockups, create new materials as needed.  </li>
</ol>
<p>After this step: <code>backend development</code>, <code>launch</code>, and <code>post-launch maintenance</code> </p>

<h3 id="1-exporting-assets-design-">1. Exporting Assets (<strong>DESIGN</strong>)</h3>
<p>After your designs are complete, you&#39;ll need to export them. The filetype depends on what type of asset you&#39;re working with. In the case of mockups, it will nearly always be one of these options:  </p>
<h4 id="file-types-">FILE TYPES:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>.png</code></strong> - used for non-photograph images (like logos or icons)</li>
<li><strong><code>.jpg</code></strong> - used for photographs</li>
<li><strong><code>.zip</code></strong> - compressed file. If you have multiple mockups, you&#39;ll want to place them in a folder, which you can compress into a zip. </li>
<li><p><strong><code>preview URL</code></strong> - provided by Adobe through xD, it previews the static mockups from a publicly available url, with extra prototype effects (like naviagting through the mockups by clicking on navigation in the design itself, page transitions, scrolling, etc.) </p>
<p>Adobe Xd&#39;s preview URL bascially allows the static mockups feel more like a real functioning website. This is very effective for communicating to our partners how a website will actually appear and feel. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example: <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/3fa87f82-9b93-4d16-ad30-8a25019b4df3/">xd.adobe.com</a> </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="programs-used-">PROGRAMS USED:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Xd - Adobe Experience Designer</strong><br>   A mockup &amp; prototype tool.<br>   <em>Exports</em>: <code>.png, .svg, .pdf, preview url</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ps - Adobe Photoshop</strong><br>   Used for a massive range of image creation / manipulation tasks.<br>   <em>Exports</em>: <code>.png, .jpg, .svg, .pdf</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ai - Adobe Illustrator</strong><br>   Creates vector art. Used primarily to create logos, icons, and illustrations.<br>   <em>Exports</em>: <code>.png, .jpg, .svg, pdf</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Balsamiq</strong><br>   A popular wireframing tool. 
  <em>Exports</em>: <code>.png, .jpg, .pdf</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-sharing-assets-within-pai-design-pm-">2. Sharing Assets Within PAI (DESIGN ---&gt; PM)</h3>
<p>Internally, we have several tools and routes by which to share files. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slack</strong> - by far, the most convenient method. Simply drag the files into the intended channel, or press the <code>+</code> button (it&#39;s sitting to the left of where you type your messages.)</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - The ol&#39; standby. While email is incredibly useful for a quick message with one or two attached images, attempting to send files larger than a few mb can take huge amounts of time, or not work at all.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Sharing</strong> - The best solution for sharing enormous files. </li>
<li><strong>Memory Stick or External HD</strong> - Data transfer, with a personal touch --- just place the assets in an external drive, and physically bring it to the PM. </li>
<li><strong>Store the Files On Our Servers</strong> - This would work essentially the same way Cloud computing works, only it&#39;s hosted on our servers. Anyone with the url should be able to access it. *</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-getting-assets-to-the-partner-pm-partner-">3. Getting Assets to the Partner (PM ---&gt; PARTNER)</h3>
<p>This step is covered by the PM department&#39;s internal processes. However, in terms of how to get the design assets to the partner, here&#39;s a few insights:</p>
<p>There are 3 primary approaches to getting assets to the client, that sidestep the potential issues. The first two relate to digital delivery:  </p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>jpgs or pngs attached to an email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum filesize for an email is <strong>20mb</strong> [^filesize] </li>
<li>The Commonwealth may even restrict this filesize limit further. </li>
<li>Anything larger than 3-5 mb will take a long time to download, so try to keep your emails below this. </li>
</ul>
<p>[^filesize]: Via <a href="https://www.outlook-apps.com/maximum-email-size/">outlook-apps.com/maximum-email-size</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A download link</strong> to files stored on our servers</p>
<ul>
<li>this sidesteps the filesize requirements and the .zip issue. </li>
<li>this may require help from a developer to set up an approriate location and the place the files onto the server 
(TODO: this process needs fleshed out)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Presentations / Review Meetings</strong>: this is covered in the next section </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="issues-to-plan-around">ISSUES TO PLAN AROUND</h4>
<p>These solutions solve these persistent issues: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No ZIP files in Emails</strong> - At present, the commonwealth won&#39;t accept .zip files sent via email. Meaning, even though email is likely the primary form of contact with the state, it is not a viable asset delivery method on its own.</li>
<li><strong>We cannot use the Cloud</strong> - The state also won&#39;t accept anything from a cloud account, either from email, and likely blocks them in their browsers. Even if you send them an email with a link to an asset stored on a Cloud service, they won&#39;t be able to even look at it. </li>
<li><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> - many agencies still use Internet Explorer (possibly in versions older than 11), which leads to its own share of technical issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-presentations-review-meetings-pm-design-partner-">4. Presentations / Review Meetings (PM + DESIGN ---&gt; PARTNER)</h3>
<p>For review meetings, in which we present our designs to the partner, it&#39;s imperative that we consider the technical limitations when meeting remotely.</p>
<p>Ideally, this presentation will have both printouts and a projector presentation with an Xd Preview URL (and .jpgs or .pngs of mockup assets available as backups). </p>
<p>Remember that the most important thing is to give the partner as close an experience to the final website as possible, to ensure the partner&#39;s opinion is untainted by unrelated technical issues.  </p>
<p><strong>Presenting Assets When Outside The Office</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Projector</strong> - The most obvious presentation option. Many of our partner&#39;s conference rooms are equiped with projectors. </p>
<p><strong>To connect your laptop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HDMI</strong> - there&#39;s normally an HDMI input for the projector (either an attached computer or a panel on a nearby wall). </li>
<li><strong>Attached Computer</strong> - you can also use an attached computer to access the files in a jump drive. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Printouts</strong> - Physically printed copies of each page of the site. </p>
<ul>
<li>For taller screenshots, try to use longer paper </li>
<li>Print copies for every person attending</li>
<li>Distribute at the beginning of the meeting</li>
<li>Printouts are great for taking notes and ensuring everyone is on the same page (literally)</li>
<li>Printouts suffer from the same non-interactvity of static jpgs. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="issues-to-plan-around">ISSUES TO PLAN AROUND</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Internet</strong> - You won&#39;t have access to their wifi, so when gathering whatever you need for the presentation, make sure they&#39;re available offline. </li>
<li><strong>No Projector</strong> - Occassionally, they won&#39;t have a projector, or you can&#39;t connect to it. </li>
</ul>
